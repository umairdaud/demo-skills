# Calculation Examples

## Example 1: High Value Policy
**Inputs:**
- Sum Insured: Rs 87,560,000
- Rate: 0.03
- Province: Punjab
- Stamp Charges: Rs 50

**Step-by-step Calculation:**
1. Basic Premium = (87,560,000 × 0.03) ÷ 100 = Rs 26,268
2. 5% of Basic Premium = 26,268 × 0.05 = Rs 1,313.4
3. Since 1,313.4 < 5000, Admin Charges = Rs 1,313.4 (uncapped)
4. Subtotal = 26,268 + 1,313.4 = Rs 27,581.4
5. Federal Surcharge (Punjab) = 27,581.4 × 0.16 = Rs 4,413.02
6. Stamp Duty = 27,581.4 × 0.01 = Rs 275.81
7. Net Premium = 27,581.4 + 4,413.02 + 275.81 + 50 = Rs 32,320.23

## Example 2: Lower Value Policy
**Inputs:**
- Sum Insured: Rs 1,000,000
- Rate: 0.02
- Province: Sindh
- Stamp Charges: Rs 20

**Step-by-step Calculation:**
1. Basic Premium = (1,000,000 × 0.02) ÷ 100 = Rs 200
2. 5% of Basic Premium = 200 × 0.05 = Rs 10
3. Since 10 < 5000, Admin Charges = Rs 10 (uncapped)
4. Subtotal = 200 + 10 = Rs 210
5. Federal Surcharge (Sindh) = 210 × 0.15 = Rs 31.5
6. Stamp Duty = 210 × 0.01 = Rs 2.1
7. Net Premium = 210 + 31.5 + 2.1 + 20 = Rs 263.6

## Example 3: Administrative Charge Cap
**Inputs:**
- Sum Insured: Rs 50,000,000
- Rate: 0.10
- Province: Punjab
- Stamp Charges: Rs 10

**Step-by-step Calculation:**
1. Basic Premium = (50,000,000 × 0.10) ÷ 100 = Rs 50,000
2. 5% of Basic Premium = 50,000 × 0.05 = Rs 2,500
3. Since 2,500 < 5000, Admin Charges = Rs 2,500 (uncapped)
4. Subtotal = 50,000 + 2,500 = Rs 52,500
5. Federal Surcharge (Punjab) = 52,500 × 0.16 = Rs 8,400
6. Stamp Duty = 52,500 × 0.01 = Rs 525
7. Net Premium = 52,500 + 8,400 + 525 + 10 = Rs 61,435

## Example 4: Administrative Charge Capped Scenario
**Inputs:**
- Sum Insured: Rs 200,000,000
- Rate: 0.10
- Province: Punjab
- Stamp Charges: Rs 10

**Step-by-step Calculation:**
1. Basic Premium = (200,000,000 × 0.10) ÷ 100 = Rs 200,000
2. 5% of Basic Premium = 200,000 × 0.05 = Rs 10,000
3. Since 10,000 > 5000, Admin Charges = Rs 5,000 (capped)
4. Subtotal = 200,000 + 5,000 = Rs 205,000
5. Federal Surcharge (Punjab) = 205,000 × 0.16 = Rs 32,800
6. Stamp Duty = 205,000 × 0.01 = Rs 2,050
7. Net Premium = 205,000 + 32,800 + 2,050 + 10 = Rs 239,860
